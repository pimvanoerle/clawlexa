# clawlexa-bridge

Host-side bridge between the clawlexa ESP32 device and an MCP agent. Runs on the
same laptop as the agent (e.g. iPinch). Phase 2: a WebSocket server the device
dials into; STT/TTS and the MCP surface land in later phases.

## Setup

```bash
cd bridge
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m clawlexa_bridge --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8765
```

Point the firmware at this host with `idf.py menuconfig` → **clawlexa** →
`Bridge host` / `Bridge port` (the device dials `ws://<host>:<port>`). Use the
laptop's LAN IP, e.g. `192.168.1.221`.

## Test

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest        # from bridge/
```

`tests/test_protocol.py` covers the pure message encode/parse; `test_server.py`
runs the real handshake over a loopback WebSocket (no device needed).

## Troubleshooting

**Device connects but the link fails (bridge logs `400 Bad Request`; device logs
`Error read response for Upgrade header`).** If loopback tests pass but the real
device can't complete the handshake, suspect the **macOS Application Firewall**
on the bridge host. It can let the TCP handshake through (the kernel even ACKs
the device's request) yet block the *Python process* from receiving the data, so
`recv()` raises `OSError: [Errno 57] Socket is not connected` and the server 400s
— a very misleading symptom that looks like a protocol bug but isn't.

The firewall is per-binary, and a venv built on the python.org framework Python
is a *different* binary from `/usr/bin/python3`. Allow it:

```bash
PYBIN=$(.venv/bin/python -c 'import sys; print(sys.executable)')
sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --add "$PYBIN"
sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --unblockapp "$PYBIN"
```

(or run the bridge from an already-allowed interpreter). Loopback always works
because it bypasses the firewall — so this only bites the real device.
